# Advanced_Scientific_Programming_with_Python_Project

## General Problem Statement:

Tumor lesions are the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection of tumors can improve the overall survival of patients. Manual annotation of tumors is highly laborious and time-consuming. We plan to develop an end-to-end automated framework for the segmentation of tumors and their metastases from whole-body PET/CT scans using deep learning.

## Problem Statement:

The current piece of code is not very organized without any documentation (Hard to read and understand). It is also not very effcient in terms of memory and speed.

## Solution:

My intent here is to convert this piece of code into a python package by having separate modules, classes, functions and add proper documentations (wherever necessary). I am also planning to use high performance computing (such as GPU acceleration) and parallel programming (multi-processing) to fastract some of the computations. Finally, I also plan to optimize the overall framework for 3D tumor segmentation. Additionally, I am also planning to include better visualization tools (related to the General Problem Statement), that will be helpful during visualization.
